# Sunflower Tracker

The Sunflower Tracker is a software system designed to address problems concerning solar panels, more specifically the problems that arise when a solar panel is placed at a fixed position which can lead to inefficient sunlight absorption. The name of the project is in reference to sunflowers, which are capable of following the sun's trajectory from east to west each day to maximize the amount of sunlight they are being exposed to. Through the use of a 2D Webots simulation, this software hopes to provide an accurate representation of how potential real hardware could behave to allow solar panels the ability to maximize sunlight exposure, just like a sunflower, and maximize power generation.

The target audience and primary users of this software would include:
- Students, researchers, and others who are looking for a hands-on simulation that can demonstrate sun-tracking behavior, which can be used for different projects.
- Homeowners that rely on solar power for their daily lives, as this can allow them to maximize their power output if what is demonstrated in the software can be applied to hardware.

## Features
- ***Auto Sun Tracking***, which is a feature that can be considered the main purpose of the software. It would allow the system to automatcially position the tracking device in the direction of the strongest source of sunlight based on data like a sun positioning model, tracking sensors, or both if necessary.
- ***User Input***, in which the software's user will be able to provide information such as the date and time and location to receive results that would be an accurate representation of what maximizing sunlight would look like in their general area.
- ***Simulation of Bad Weather***, which would allow the software system to take inconvenient weather conditions into account when providing results about the amount of sunlight that was absorbed, accounting for cloudy and rainy skies or any other inconvenient conditions. This provides a more realistic simulator that can test how well any potential hardware would work in these conditions.
- ***Manual Control***, which is a feature that can allow the user to manually set the direction of the tracker or temporarily pause the ability to track at their leisure, allowing for better control over the system from the user's end.
- ***Logging***, where the system will come with the ability to store records of information such as the device's angle, light intensity, and any potential errors that can occur during the tracking process. These records would also have timestamps that allow the users and developers to know exactly when something occurred, whether it was a good or bad occurrence.
